# Javascript By Subject 

Important javascript topics, sorted by subject they cover. Not all are required, I tried to keep the required to the minimum that you need to have a basic understanding.

[Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

1. Minimize the sections
2. Open the parent section "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification"
3. Open "Basic JavaScript"

Anything with a * in front is optional, good to know but not used on a daily basis

## Arrays
- [ ] Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays **_javascript allows storing multiple types. We typically store one type of data per array_**
- [ ] *Nest one Array within Another Array
- [ ] *Accessing Nested Arrays
- [ ] Access Array Data with Indexes

- [ ] *Stand in Line **_arrays and function project_**

## Conditions
- [ ] Understanding Boolean Values
- [ ] Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
- [ ] Comparison with the Equality Operator
- [ ] Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator **_We prefer strict equality_**
- [ ] Comparison with the Inequality Operator **_Fun tidbit, we refer to ! as Bang. Exclamation is too many sylabols_**
- [ ] Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator **_Again prefer strict comparisons_**
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
- **_The above four are important, but the lessons are optional understand the equal and greater/less than and plain greater/less than_**
- [ ] Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
- [ ] Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
- [ ] Introducing Else Statements
- [ ] Introducing Else If Statements
- [ ] Logical Order in If Else Statements **_A little more advanced, but very imporant to keep in mind_**
- [ ] Chaining If Else Statements
- [ ] Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
- [ ] Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
- [ ] Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements **_Also referred to as "Fall through"_**
- [ ] Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- [ ] *Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators **_We discourage this pattern, but it is good to know about_**
- [ ] *Golf Code **_Conditionals Project_**

## Objects
- [ ] Build JavaScript Objects
- [ ] Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
- [ ] Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
- [ ] *Accessing Object Properties with Variables
- [ ] Updating Object Properties
- [ ] *Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
- [ ] *Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
- [ ] Manipulating Complex Objects **_JSON_**
- [ ] Accessing Nested Objects

## Loops
- [ ] Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
- [ ] Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
- [ ] Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop **_Although later you will learn about a method to do this differently_**
- [ ] *Nesting For Loops **_Probably will not use often here_**
- [ ] *Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops **_Only occasionally useful_**

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] *Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
- [ ] *Use the parseInt Function
- [ ] *Prevent Object Mutation

## ES6
_We typically use ES6 in our projects. Which means you will see a lot of these, especially let, const and import_**
- [ ] Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
- [ ] Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
- [ ] Mutate an Array Declared with const
- [ ] Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions **_You will see lots of these_**
- [ ] Write Arrow Functions with Parameters
- [ ] Write Higher Order Arrow Functions **_Perhaps the most common usage of arrow functions_**
- [ ] *Set Default Parameters for Your Functions
- [ ] *Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters **_We use this in React quite often_**
- [ ] *Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
- [ ] *Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects **_You are likely to encounter this in React code_**
- [ ] Create Strings using Template Literals
- [ ] Understand the Differences Between import and require
- [ ] Use export to Reuse a Code Block
