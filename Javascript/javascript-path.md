# Javascript Path 

Important javascript topics, sorted by subject they cover. Not all are required, I tried to keep the required to the minimum that you need to have a basic understanding.

This is a suggested path that jumps around to try and get you what you need in the easiest and fastest path.

- [ ] 54 Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

## Supplimentary
By this point you should have a good understanding to tackle the following lessons in any order
### Operators
- [ ] Increment a Number with JavaScript
- [ ] Decrement a Number with JavaScript
- [ ] *[Decimal Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems)
- [ ] *Finding a Remainder in JavaScript **_Modulus %_**

### Strings
- [ ] Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
- [ ] *Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
- [ ] Escape Sequences in Strings
- [ ] Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
- [ ] Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
- [ ] *Constructing Strings with Variables
- [ ] *Find the Length of a String
- [ ] *Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
- [ ] Understand String Immutability
- [ ] *Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
- [ ] Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String **_This one is good to understand 0 based length_**
- [ ] *Word Blanks **_MadLibs example_**

### Arrays
- [ ] *Nest one Array within Another Array
- [ ] *Accessing Nested Arrays
- [ ] *Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
- [ ] *Manipulate Arrays With push()
- [ ] *Manipulate Arrays With pop()
- [ ] *Manipulate Arrays With shift()
- [ ] *Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
- [ ] *Shopping List **_Project to test array knowledge_**

### Functions
- [ ] *Global Scope and Functions **_Good to learn though_**
- [ ] *Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
- [ ] *Stand in Line **_arrays and function project_**

### Conditions
- [ ] Comparison with the Inequality Operator **_Fun tidbit, we refer to ! as Bang. Exclamation is too many sylabols_**
- [ ] Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator **_Again prefer strict comparisons_**
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
- **_The above four are important, but the lessons are optional understand the equal and greater/less than and plain greater/less than Also note there is no strict greater/lesser than_**
- [ ] Chaining If Else Statements
- [ ] Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
- [ ] Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
- [ ] Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements **_Also referred to as "Fall through"_**
- [ ] *Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators **_We discourage this pattern, but it is good to know about_**
- [ ] *Golf Code **_Conditionals Project_**

### Objects
- [ ] Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
- [ ] *Accessing Object Properties with Variables
- [ ] *Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
- [ ] *Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object

### Loops
- [ ] *Nesting For Loops **_Probably will not use often here_**
- [ ] *Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops **_Only occasionally useful_**

### Miscellaneous
- [ ] *Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
- [ ] *Use the parseInt Function
- [ ] *Prevent Object Mutation

### ES6

- [ ] Mutate an Array Declared with const
- [ ] *Set Default Parameters for Your Functions
- [ ] *Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters **_We use this in React quite often_**
- [ ] *Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
- [ ] *Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects **_You are likely to encounter this in React code_**
