# Web Structure

## HTML basics

The goal here is to understand what an element is. Also comments and how they work in HTML

- [ ] Say Hello to HTML Elements
- [ ] Uncomment HTML
- [ ] Comment out HTML

## CSS basics

Mostly I focus on selectors. The actual styling of a page is less important for building tests

- [ ] Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
- [ ] Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
- [ ] Set the id of an Element
- [ ] Use an id Attribute to Style an Element
