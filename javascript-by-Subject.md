# Javascript By Subject 

Important javascript topics, sorted by subject they cover. Not all are required, I tried to keep the required to the minimum that you need to have a basic understanding.

[Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) 

1. Minimize the sections
2. Open the parent section "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification"
3. Open "Basic JavaScript"

## Variables
- [ ] Declare Javascript Variables
- [ ] Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
- [ ] Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
- [ ] Understanding Uninitialized Variables
- [ ] Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

## Operators
- [ ] Increment a Number with JavaScript
- [ ] Decrement a Number with JavaScript
- [ ] Decimal Reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems
- [ ] Finding a Remainder in JavaScript (Modulus %)

## Strings (* are optional)
- [ ] Declare String Variables (Our code conventions use single quotes)
- [ ] Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
- [ ] *Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
- [ ] Escape Sequences in Strings
- [ ] Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
- [ ] Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
- [ ] *Constructing Strings with Variables
- [ ] *Find the Length of a String
- [ ] *Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
- [ ] Understand String Immutability
- [ ] *Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
- [ ] Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String (This one is good to understand 0 based length)
- [ ] *Word Blanks (MadLibs example)

## Arrays
- [ ] Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays (javascript allows storing multiple types. We typically store one type of data per array)
- [ ] *Nest one Array within Another Array
- [ ] Access Array Data with Indexes
- [ ] Modify Array Data With Indexes (Note the connection between this and immutability of strings)
- [ ] *Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
- [ ] Manipulate Arrays With push()
- [ ] Manipulate Arrays With pop()
- [ ] Manipulate Arrays With shift()
- [ ] Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
- [ ] *Shopping List (Project to test array knowledge)

## Functions
- [ ] Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
- [ ] Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
- [ ] *Global Scope and Functions (Good to learn though)
- [ ] *Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
- [ ] Assignment with a Returned Value
- [ ] *Stand in Line (arrays and function project)

## Conditions
- [ ] Understanding Boolean Values
- [ ] Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
- [ ] Comparison with the Equality Operator
- [ ] Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator (We prefer strict equality)
- [ ] Comparison with the Inequality Operator (Fun tidbit, we refer to ! as Bang. Exclamation is too many sylabols)
- [ ] Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator (Again prefer strict comparisons)
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Operator
- [ ] *Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
- [ ] (The above four are important, but the lessons are optional understand the equal and greater/less than and plain greater/less than)
- [ ] Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
- [ ] Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
- [ ] Introducing Else Statements
- [ ] Introducing Else If Statements
- [ ] Logical Order in If Else Statements (A little more advanced, but very imporant to keep in mind)
- [ ] Chaining If Else Statements
- [ ] Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
- [ ] Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
- [ ] Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements (Also referred to as "Fall through")
- [ ] *Golf Code(Condition Project)
